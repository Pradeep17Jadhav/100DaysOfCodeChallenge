I think I have forgotten most of the things about C++ that learned in college. Decision of starting with easiest programs was correct.

1) Today I learned some of the built in C++ functions.
2) Tried leetcode for the first time.
3) Amazed to see how leetcode shows runtime and memory used by the program.
4) Learned about vector arrays.
